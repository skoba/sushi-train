薬剤の詳細な投与法、提供方法を伝えるために、投与速度(rate)とdoseQuantityの両方の情報を提供することができる。もし、投与速度が変更されるようであれば、ローカルルールや制限に基づいて、全ての変更は新しいバージョンのMeddicationRequestに更新された投与速度を記録するか、MedicationRequestの新しいインスタンスに新しい投与速度を記録されるようにするべきである。

rateRatioとrateQuantityのいずれかを使って時間内の投与速度（たとえば100ml/hour)を指定することができる。rateQuantityを使うには、ml/hourが投与速度の単位と言うだけではなく、時間が分母として指定されているということを示しているというようなUCUM単位の文法をシステムがパース可能であることが求められる。500mlを2時間でというような投与速度指示では、rateRatioがrateQuantityで250mg/hourとするよりもセマンティクスを正確に伝えることができるかもしれない。","患者の体内に導入される、あるいはされた薬剤の速度を指定する。一般的には、たとえば1時間あたり100mlあるいは100ml/hrのように注射の速度を示す。たとえば、500mlを2時間でというように、単位時間あたりの速さを表現することもできる。その他、200マイクログラム/minや200マイクログラム/1分, 1 リットル/8時間のような表現もできる。しばしば、投与速度を投与総量/ 投与総時間で表ような場合に投与時間が明示される（たとえば、500ml/2時間という場合は、投与時間が2時間であることを示している）。しかしながら、投与速度で投与時間が明示されない場合（たとえば、250ml/毎時)は、timing.repeat.durationが注射の総投与時間を示すためには必要となる。","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
