The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. ""Patient"" is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient. Absolute URLs are only allowed for logical models (and can only be used in references in logical models, not resources).

This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.

ターゲットリソースの識別子。これは、他のリソースを直接参照する方法がない場合に使用される。これは、リソースが表すエンティティがFHIRサーバーを介して利用できないため、またはリソースの作成者が既知の識別子を実際の場所に変換する方法がないためである 。 Reference.identifierが実際にFHIRインスタンスとして公開されているものを指している必要はないが、FHIRインスタンスとして公開されることが期待されるビジネス概念を指している必要があり、そのインスタンスは参照で許可されているFHIRリソースタイプとなる。","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).

参照の代わりに識別子が提供される場合、参照を処理するシステムは、識別子が使用されるビジネスコンテキストを理解している場合にのみ、識別子を参照に解決できる。これはグローバルな場合もあるが（たとえば、国民ID）、そうでない場合もある。このため、参照を操作するために説明されている便利なメカニズム（チェーン、インクルードなど）はどれも不可能であり、サーバーが参照を解決できると期待されるべきではない。サーバーは、識別子ベースの参照をそのまま受け入れ、解決したり、拒否したりする場合がある。CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicyを参照。

識別子とリテラル参照の両方が提供されている場合は、リテラル参照が優先される。リソースを処理するアプリケーションは、識別子がリテラル参照と一致することを確認できるが、確認することは必須ではない。

論理参照をリテラル参照に変換するアプリケーションは、論理参照を存在させたままにするか、削除するかを選択できる。

参照は、FHIRリソースとして表現できる可能性のある構造を指すことを目的としているが、実際のFHIRリソースインスタンスとして存在する必要はない。ただし、アプリケーションが参照のターゲットを実際に見つけたい場合を除く。識別子と呼ばれるコンテンツは、参照に許可されるリソースタイプの制限によって暗示される論理的な制約を満たす必要がある。たとえば、タイプがReference（Observation | DiagnosticReport）の場合、薬の処方箋の識別子を送信することは正当ではない。 Reference.identifierのユースケースの1つは、FHIR表現が存在しない状況である（タイプはReference（Any）である）。","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.identifier",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

Typically, the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time, e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.  Other examples:  200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.

Typically, the MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate element is not used to convey an average rate.

レートが時間の経過とともに変化し、これをMedicationAdministrationで記述する場合は、各変更を、特定のMedicationAdministration.dosage.rateと、レート変更が発生した日時を使用して、個別のMedicationAdministrationとして記述する必要がある。通常、MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate要素は、平均レートを伝達するためには使用されない。","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
