","Kind of organization / 組織の種類","The kind(s) of organization that this is.


その種類の組織。","Organizations can be corporations, wards, sections, clinical teams, government departments, etc. Note that code is generally a classifier of the type of organization; in many applications, codes are used to identity a particular organization (say, ward) as opposed to another of the same type - these are identifiers, not codes

When considering if multiple types are appropriate, you should evaluate if child organizations would be a more appropriate use of the concept, as different types likely are in different sub-areas of the organization. This is most likely to be used where type values have orthogonal values, such as a religious, academic and medical center.

We expect that some jurisdictions will profile this optionality to be a single cardinality.


組織は、企業、病棟、セクション、臨床チーム、政府部門などにすることができます。多くのアプリケーションでは、コードは、特定の組織を識別するために使用されている（と言う、病棟）別の同じタイプのものとは対照的に - これらは識別子ではなく、コードです。


複数のタイプが適切かどうかを検討する際には、異なるタイプが組織の異なるサブ領域に存在する可能性が高いため、子どもの組織の方がより適切な使用法であるかどうかを評価する必要があります。これは、宗教、学術、医療センターのように、タイプの価値観が直交する場合に使用される可能性が高い。


いくつかの法域では、このオプション性を単一のカーディナリティとしてプロファイルすると予想される。","Need to be able to track the kind of organization that this is - different organization types have different uses.
