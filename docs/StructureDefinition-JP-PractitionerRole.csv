この役割を持つ医療従事者のために運営されているサービスへのアクセスを提供する技術的なエンドポイント。","References SHALL be a reference to an actual FHIR resource, and SHALL be resolveable (allowing for access control, temporary unavailability, etc.). Resolution can be either by retrieval from the URL, or, where applicable by resource type, by treating an absolute reference as a canonical URL and looking it up in a local registry/repository.
参照は、実際のFHIRリソースへの参照である必要があり、内容に辿り着ける（解決できる）必要があります（アクセス制御、一時的な使用不可などを考慮に入れる）。解決は、URLから取得するか、リソースタイプによって該当する場合は、絶対参照を正規URLとして扱い、ローカルレジストリ/リポジトリで検索することによって行うことができる。","Organizations have multiple systems that provide various services and ,ay also be different for practitioners too.So the endpoint satisfies the need to be able to define the technical connection details for how to connect to them, and for what purpose.

組織には、様々なサービスを提供するための複数のシステムがあり、また、医療従事者にとっても様々である。
