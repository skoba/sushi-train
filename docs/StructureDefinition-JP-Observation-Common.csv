One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.

ヌル値または例外値は、FHIRオブザベーションで2つの方法で表すことができる。 1つの方法は、それらを値セットに含めて、値の例外を表す方法である。たとえば、血清学的検査の測定値は、「検出された」、「検出されなかった」、「決定的でない」、または「検体が不十分」である可能性がある。別の方法は、実際の観測にvalue要素を使用し、明示的なdataAbsentReason要素を使用して例外的な値を記録することである。たとえば、測定が完了しなかった場合、dataAbsentReasonコード「error」を使用できる。この場合には、観測値は、報告する値がある場合にのみ報告される可能性があることに注意する必要がある。たとえば、差分セルカウント値は> 0の場合にのみ報告される場合がある。これらのオプションのため、nullまたは例外値の一般的な観測値を解釈するにはユースケースの合意が必要である。","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason","",,,,"Observation.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6
